# DiGist
**DiGist** (pronounced "digest") is a web platform that helps you to collate your best Gists together in blog format.

## Why
During CS classes in college, I love to create notes using Gists – it's super elegant and easy to set up. The issue? The Gists are everywhere and are unorganised amidst unrelated Gists, especially during revision time. What I wish I had back then was a tool that allowed me to pool Gists of choice together in one place – like a flipbook, of sorts. 

**Imagine that!**

After collation, I could read my notes like any other blog or online textbook, making it simpler to digest (hence, the name).

## Usage Instructions
*DiGist* isn't only for CS nerds taking notes – it's for everyone with something to say. GitHub Gists provides support for markdown (what blogs are typically written with) and a boatload of programming languages. This makes it a really versatile blogging platform; it has zero set up issues and all you need to do is visit the [Gist website](http://gist.github.com).
